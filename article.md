With the boom of Internet, People have started producing more and more data. Companies have understood the importance of data and possibile opportunities it brings to the company. 

In 2011, Harvard Business labeled the profession **Data Scientists** as "**The sexiest job of the 21st century**."
 
Data is everywhere. Everyone wants get involved with this power. However, fruits of this field are so **unripe** that people tends to misunderstand Data jobs, beliving people involved with Data jobs as some magicians who takes Data and could potentially implement their product or service.

Throwing out a clear light, In this article, We'll try to clear out the skepticism built around Data jobs, discussing in detail the differences between **Data Scientist**, **Data Engineer** and **Data Architecture**.

# There's even a Differece ?

**Yes**. Although they work together to harness the power of Data, they differ from each other in terms of their Job roles.

Let's take a small example to clear this out..

Imagine three people : Ben, Jonny, Cris.

So, Ben comes out with a plan to create a machine where one can put up a raw Apple and a processed Jam would come out from the another end.

He contacts his friend Jonny. And together they work and develop a machine based on Ben's idea. 

Now they wants to use the power of machine to further improve its commercial use. They contact Cris. Now Cris uses the processed Jam given by machine to create Jam Sandwich which he sells out and everyone gets the profit.

In terms of Data Jobs, Ben played the **role of Data Architect**, Jonny played the **role of Data Engineer** and Cris was **the Data Scientist**.

# So, How these subfields are different?

* **Data Architect**
<img src="images\DA.png" alt="drawing" width="200" align="right"/>
A Data Architect provides the blueprint for Data Management Systems. He's responsible for understanding business objective and existing data infrastructure, and then work out a plan for integrating, centralizing and maintaining all the data, shaping the data architecture or pipelines as per the requirements and standards.

<br>

* **Data Engineer**

A Data Engineer develop, construct, test and maintain architectures. As a hard core engineer, they work along with a Data Architect to develop such high performance data pipelines and work on Data reliability, efficiency, and quality. In short, He deals with gathering the data and process them.

<br>

* **Data Scientist**

<img src="images\DS.png" alt="drawing" width="200" align="right"/>
A Data Scientist uses the pipelines or architectures designed by Data Engineer and tries to extract valuable insights from the data. He's more mathematically inclined, usually trained in areas like Machine Learning, Statistics and some hardcore domains like 
Text Analytics(NLP), Computer Vision(CV) etc


# What are the skills needed for these roles?

![apple](images\chart.png)

A **Data Architect** plans a stragety how to solve a business problem. He may or may not have technical background but he possess immense amount of In-depth knowledge of Database architecture. He's also good with Spreadsheets, BI tools and Extraction Transformation and Load (ETL)

Some of the other important skills he possess are :

* Business Skill
* Programming Skills
* Data Modelling
* Applied Mathâ€™s and Statistics
* Design Skills
* Excellent Communication Skill
* Databases and Cloud Architecture
* Creative and Analytical Problem Solving
* Ability to use a variety of Design/Visualization tools

A **Data Engineer** develops large and manages large databases and create data pipelines.  So, He generally comes from a technical background and usually has a deep knowledge and expertise in one or more different database softwares like SQL, NoSQl.

Some of the other important skills he possess are :

* Data APIs
* Database Systems
* Data warehousing solutions
* Data Modeling and ETL tools
* Knowledge of algorithms and data structures
* Python, Java, and Scala programming language
* Understanding the basics of distributed systems

# Closing Remark

Given above is an interpretation of what we have observered while researching at the time of writing this article. We tried to explore some well known but missunderstood Job Proflies in the field of Data.

Restating, Data is everywhere. Every company wants a guy who can bring out the potential out of these Data that can change the world we are looking at right now. Pursue the field that you personally love and have a passion for, irrespoective of its scope and salary, because in the end, it'll bring of an immense pleasure and satisfaction.
